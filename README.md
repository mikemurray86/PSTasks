# PSTasks

This module contains functions that implement a powershell version of the todo.txt task management model to help keep track of projects. It imposes additional structure above the standards expected by todo.txt and therefore is not a true implementation.

it was originally written to help me work with pester on a module that had a good amount of functionality to ensure an adequate number of testing opportunities.
